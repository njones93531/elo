# elo
elo.py finds the limiting distribution of Markov chains with state space 1000-2800 representing the elo score of a player P of skill level 1500 playing against a queue of identical opponents each with score and skill Elo_a in {1000, 1500, 2000}. 

elo.png shows the limiting distributions all align at 2800, meaning that playing infinite games, Player P's elo score converges to 2800 even though their actual skill does not improve.
